        <p>When I decided to make a number game and started thinking of its design,
            one refernce came to my mind. It was an old computer from the <i>Fallout</i> game
            which you could find in <i>Glow</i> location. That was an intelligent machine you could talk 
            to and play a game of chess. That is why this computer is so Fallout-like.
